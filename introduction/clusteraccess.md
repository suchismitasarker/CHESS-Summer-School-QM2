## 🔐 Accessing CHESS Computing Resources
Follow the steps below to log in and start an interactive session on the CHESS cluster.

#### ✅ Step 1: Open Your Terminal

- On Mac/Linux: Open the Terminal application
- On Windows: Use PowerShell, Command Prompt, or tools like Git Bash
- [Youtube video -however follow the below steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f-zIEy6VRI)


#### ✅ Step 2: Connect via SSH
- In your terminal, type the following command:
    - `ssh <username>@lnx201.classe.cornell.edu`
    - 👉 Replace <username> with your assigned CLASSE username
Example:
  -   `ssh js1234@lnx201.classe.cornell.edu`
  -   📌 You may be prompted to:
  -   Accept the host key (type yes)
  -   Enter your password

#### ✅ Step 3: Start an Interactive Job Session
  - Once logged in, run:
        `qrsh -q interactive.q -l mem_free=200G -pe sge_pe 8` 

✅ What This Command Does
qrsh → starts an interactive job session
-q interactive.q → selects the interactive queue
-l mem_free=200G → requests 200 GB RAM
-pe sge_pe 8 → requests 8 CPU cores


#### ✅ Step 4: Wait for Job Allocation

The system will allocate resources
Once ready, your prompt will update
You are now running on a compute node 🎉

#### ✅ Step 6: Activate your own environment
    - source /nfs/chess/sw/qm2_BO/bin/activate    

✅ Step 5: Start Your Work
You can now:
Run Python scripts
Use Jupyter notebooks
Process synchrotron data
Execute training jobs


## ⚠️ Important Notes

> [!WARNING]
> Activate your own environment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always request only the resources you need to avoid long wait times.

> [!TIP]
> If your job takes too long to start, consider requesting fewer resources.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not run heavy computations directly on the login node (`lnx201`).
